Joint Subscriber (c++ and python)
    Task: Implement a ros node that: 
        a) Subscribes to the topic /joint_states 
        b) Prints to the terminal the current joint position every 2 seconds
        
        Hopefully Helpful Hints:
            You can get info on the topic using `rostopic info {topic_name}`
            If you want to check the name of the topics in use try `rostopic list`
    
Joint Publisher (c++ and python)
    Task: Create a ros node that can:
        a) Be given the joint interface at startup (either using rosparams or args)
        b) Apply a sin wave to the joint
        c) Allow the joint interface and controller parameters to be modified by a ros service

	Hopefully Helpful Hints:
		Use rostopic list to find the topics for the joint controllers
		Look at the positition the robot starts in, it may be close to a joint limit 
		
Extra (this will come in handy later):
    1. Launch the youbot simulator using:
        `roslaunch youbot_simulator youbot_sim.launch gui:=true trajectory_interface:=true`
    2. Look at the new topic for interfacing with the youbot
    3. Make a publisher that can control all the joints at once (apply a sin wave again just to test it out)
